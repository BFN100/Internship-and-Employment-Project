# Internship-and-Employment-Project
It was my final project to graduate from the New Media Programming College, we did it in a group of 5.

I worked with my colleagues to make this project work, but I made the prototype chosen by the client, I participated in the design, documentation and the front-end so I wanted to put here the experience I gained and what were the results obtained.

I made my prototype in Figma, based on the needs of our client, according to the needs of the users of this system and I also thought about the ease of creating the project on our side (programmers).

Client: Responsible for marketing at College Institut Grasset

Users: Administrators (she, college coordinators, among others), Partners (companies that form a partnership with the college) and Students (former and current college students who are looking for an internship and/or job).

Based on meetings with the client and the project's time and team, we created a schedule and separated the requirements.

The site is all in French because that was the client's need, but you will be able to understand how it works by watching the videos I made.

I made a video about my design made in figma and a video showing the interface of each user of the system.

As this was a real project I requested permission from Institut Grasset to insert it in my portfolio and got this permission, so I'm inserting it here, but I can't explain details for confidentiality reasons.

The final result had some design changes due to the short time to complete the project (less than two months), but the system was as documented in the meetings between our team and the client and met their needs and expectations.

This image shows the general of my design:
